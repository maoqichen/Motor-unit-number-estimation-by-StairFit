# Motor-unit-number-estimation-by-StairFit
This is a free and open source Matlab program for StairFit motor unit number estimation (MUNE) based on a compound muscle action potential (CMAP) scan. The program fits the CMAP scan using an increasing staircase function. As a result of searching the best fitting model, MUNE becomes available together with other useful information, including motor unit activation threshold, action potential amplitude, etc. 

Details of StairFit MUNE can be found in the following paper:
